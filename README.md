WSP001 - Smart Fisheries Platform


Welcome to WSP001: The Smart Fisheries Platform

WSP001 is an innovative project developed by Accurate Culture, aimed at transforming the seafood industry through cutting-edge technologies. By integrating blockchain, IoT, and AI, this platform enhances transparency, traceability, and sustainability in the seafood supply chain. With WSP001, stakeholders across the seafood industry—from fishermen to consumers—can access actionable insights, support responsible fishing practices, and build a sustainable future for our oceans.

Project Description

The WSP001 platform tackles the pressing issues in the seafood industry, including illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing, sustainability challenges, and supply chain transparency. This platform provides:

Real-Time Data Monitoring: Leverages IoT sensors and real-time data analytics to monitor catch rates, fuel efficiency, and more, supporting data-driven decision-making.

Blockchain-Based Traceability: Ensures that every seafood product’s journey from catch to consumer is verifiable, enhancing trust and reducing “mystery fish” in the marketplace.

Predictive Analytics and AI: Empowers stakeholders with predictive insights on fish stocks, market demand, and supply chain trends, promoting sustainable practices.

Enhanced Security and Privacy: Utilizes robust encryption, access controls, and data anonymization to secure sensitive information and maintain user trust.

Scalable Architecture: Built on a microservices architecture, WSP001 supports seamless scaling and adaptability to meet the demands of an evolving industry.


Project Setup

To set up the WSP001 platform on your local environment, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Docker (recommended for simplified deployment)

Node.js (for front-end development)

Git


Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/WSP001.git
cd WSP001


2. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and create a virtual environment:

cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables in a .env file (example provided in .env.example).



3. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run build  # Builds the frontend



4. Run the Application Using Docker (recommended for streamlined deployment)

Ensure Docker is running, then use the following command to build and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build

This will launch the backend, frontend, and any required services (e.g., databases, cache) in Docker containers.



5. Run Tests

Run unit tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:

cd backend
pytest




Usage

Key Features

Data Logging: Monitor and log real-time data from fishing vessels, including catch rates, location, and fuel usage.

Traceability Dashboard: View the full lifecycle of seafood products from capture to consumer, ensuring complete transparency.

Predictive Analytics: Access AI-driven predictions for fish stocks, demand trends, and sustainability metrics.

User Permissions: Admin, Operator, and Viewer roles control access to features and data, ensuring secure and managed operations.


API Usage

The WSP001 platform provides a comprehensive REST API to interact with data. Below are examples of key API endpoints:

POST /api/v1/catch_log: Log new catch data for a vessel.

GET /api/v1/traceability/{product_id}: Retrieve the traceability history of a seafood product.

POST /api/v1/analytics/predict_demand: Request demand predictions based on historical data.

Real-Time Monitoring

For real-time data monitoring, ensure the IoT devices on vessels are connected. Data will flow into the system continuously, updating the dashboard and generating alerts if anomalies are detected.
